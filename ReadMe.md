The Card spills out of the row on medium and larger screens

Appropriate use of Margins and Padding==== maybe??

<!-- Sticky Navbar on scroll -->
<!-- Add some CSS Animations to the page --> Ugly submit button
<!-- Utilize scroll to in page navigation -->
<!-- Swap one of your images for a <video> -->
<!-- Utilizes custom font on at least one element -->
<!-- Specified elements order changes based on screen size -->
<!-- The Text Over Image is hidden on mobile (@media Rule) -->
<!-- Cards are vertically centered with the center card larger for emphasis -->
<!-- Must use external Icon library (FontAwesome, Material Icons, etc.) --> Fighter Jet in nav bar

-----Notes------
TODO
TO SUBMIT THE LINK IN codeworks site- not time stamp @ G-hub

fighter jet icon- the one that worked
<i class="fa fa-fighter-jet" aria-hidden="true"></i>

Ask about the operation of the text over image display/hidden operation using @media. Is it because its not in a container-flex.

The offset and cta box are keys in moving the li over to the right side of the page
