-----Notes------
TODO
--assets file to put images in-- dont forget about the note in the word doc about the file path to link it so it works.

--Issues with the in line txt coloring for icons
--Issues with linking the mdi file and operation - bypass by changing color before download add to asset file. I know it will be harder to update if I change themes. Link issue??? Ask about at the tutor sessions if I am still in the course.

--over flow container card- maybe make the height width fixed on the card and container
